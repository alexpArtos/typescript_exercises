This directory gathers a mix of code in typescript. In ./src, it covers mostly basic data structures and the corresponding tests. These can be run with
`npm run test <spec file name and path>`

In `src/leetcode` are some solutions to Leetcode problems. These need to be run with `tsx` and a helper script `run.sh` is provided to simplify this execution.
